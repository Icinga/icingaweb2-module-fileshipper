Icinga Web 2 Fileshipper module
===============================

The main purpose of this module is to extend [Icinga Director](https://github.com/icinga/icingaweb2-module-director)
using some of it's exported hooks. Based on them it offers an `Import Source`
able to deal with `CSV`, `JSON`, `YAML` and `XML` files. It also offers the
possibility to deploy hand-crafted [Icinga 2](https://github.com/Icinga/icinga2)
config files through the `Icinga Director`.
